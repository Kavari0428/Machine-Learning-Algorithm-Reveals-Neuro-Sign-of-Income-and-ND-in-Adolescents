# ABCD Machine Learning Income and Neighborhood Disadvantage Study



Code needed for the analyses conducted in manuscript: "Machine Learning Algorithm Reveals Neurodevelopmental Signatures of Combined Family Income and Neighborhood Disadvantage in Adolescents"

The code is split into three files for the sake of cohesion:
1. Pre-analysis
2. Analysis
3. Figures/Tables

   
Pre-analysis file contains code that reads in data and creates all functions used throughout the analyses including those needed for creating figures 

Analysis file contains all execution of every analysis done for the manuscript

Figure/Table file creates figures and tables for publication. 

Data from the ABCD Study is needed to complete the analyses.
