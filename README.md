# ABCD Machine Learning Income and Neighborhood Disadvantage Study


This repository stores the R code for for the analyses conducted in the manuscript: "Machine Learning Algorithm Reveals Neurodevelopmental Signatures of Combined Family Income and Neighborhood Disadvantage in Adolescents"

The code is split into three files for the sake of cohesion:
1. Pre-analysis
2. Analysis
3. Figures/Tables


Pre-analysis file contains code that reads in data and creates all functions used throughout the analyses including those needed for creating figures 
   - Data is not shared
   - You should download and collate data into a folder titled "5.1 Release" inside of a folder named Income_ND
   - Make sure working directory is set to Income_ND on your device. 

Analysis file contains all execution of every analysis done for the manuscript
   - Make sure working directory is set to Income_ND on your device. 

Figure/Table file creates figures and tables for publication. 
   - Make sure working directory is set to Income_ND on your device. 

Data from the ABCD Study is needed to complete the analyses.
   - Data needed includes sMRI, rs-fMRI, and DTI along with demographic and motion data
